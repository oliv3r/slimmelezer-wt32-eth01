# SlimmeLezer + esp32 + ethernet
![WT32-ETH01](/images/WT32-ETH01.jpg)
## WT32-ETH01 based
For this version I was looking for an esp32 and ethernet. The best version I could find is the [WT32-ETH01 from wireless-tag](http://www.wireless-tag.com/portfolio/wt32-eth01/). These boards can be found on [AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=WT32-ETH01) for [around â‚¬15](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004432624600.html) (including shipping)

I've designed this prototype for using ethernet only. Obviously the wireless network can be used too. The down side of esp32 + wifi + esphome is that it draws quite a lot of power (and with a lot I mean >250mA). Therefore it must be powered via the USB-C port to provice the necessary power.

On my test meter Sagemcom T210-D (DSMR 5) and my personal meter ISKRA AM550 (DSMR 5) the P1 port provides enough power for using it with ethernet.

### Pin-out

### Serial pins for flashing the esp32
Looking at the top-part of the pin-out image, those pins are used for flashing the esp32. The TXD0, RXD0, IO0, EN, GND and 3v3. Those pins are directly connected to the ch340 serial chip.
### Serial pin for data
In the middle left you see the RXD and TXD for serial communication. Only the RXD is used as DSMR is an oneway communication protocol.
### Ethernet pins for ESPHome
The following settings are used in case of using ESPHome:
```yaml
ethernet:
  type: LAN8720
  mdc_pin: GPIO23
  mdio_pin: GPIO18
  clk_mode: GPIO0_IN
  phy_addr: 1
  power_pin: GPIO16
```
See more information about ethernet and esphome on [their website](https://esphome.io/components/ethernet.html#configuration-for-wireless-tag-wt32-eth01).
