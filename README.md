## WT32-ETH01 based
For this version I was looking for an esp32 and ethernet. The best version I could find is the [WT32-ETH01 from wireless-tag](http://www.wireless-tag.com/portfolio/wt32-eth01/). These boards can be found on [AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=WT32-ETH01) for [around â‚¬15](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004432624600.html) (including shipping)
### Pin-out

### Serial pins for flashing the esp32
Looking at the top-part of the pin-out image, those pins are used for flashing the esp32. The TXD0, RXD0, IO0, EN, GND and 3v3. Those pins are directly connected to the ch340 serial chip.
### Serial pin for data
In the middle left you see the RXD and TXD for serial communication. Only the RXD is used as DSMR is an oneway communication protocol.
